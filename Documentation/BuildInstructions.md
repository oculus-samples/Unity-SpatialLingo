- Switch to the SpatialLingo-Dev build profile. The platform may need to be switched to Android first, if it's not already the target platform.
- Click the Build button to create a build, then select a location for the .apk to be created.
- Using [Meta Quest Developer Hub (MQDH)](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/unity/ts-mqdh/), go to the Device Manager tab, and drag and drop the .apk onto your connected device
