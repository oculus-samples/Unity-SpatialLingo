  m_overrideMarkdownText: "# Mixed Reality Utility Kit (MRUK)\n\n## Introduction\n\nMeta's
    [Mixed Reality Utility Kit](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/unity/unity-mr-utility-kit-overview/)
    is a set of tools that provide spatial data and tracking, providing apps with
    a better understanding of the user's immediate environment.\n\n## Use in Spatial
    Lingo\n\nMRUK is used for the initial placement of Golly Gosh and the tree upon
    entering the app. It helps ensure the spawn point is in a sensible location for
    the user, allowing the user to interact with Golly Gosh and the tree in a multitude
    of setups and environments.\n\nThis is used in [RoomSense.cs](../Assets/SpatialLingo/Scripts/Utilities/RoomSense.cs),
    in the `SpawnCoroutine()` function. First, MRUK's room object is queried. [`FindSpawnPositions.StartSpawn()`](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/unity/unity-mr-utility-kit-content-placement#findspawnpositions)
    is called to instantiate a dummy object, which is then adjusted further to ensure
    Golly Gosh is properly facing the user. To prevent a \"teleporting\" effect from
    multiple transform updates, the dummy object is swapped for Golly Gosh as soon
    as the transform is finalized.\n\nAlso see [RoomSense.prefab](../Assets/SpatialLingo/Prefabs/Utilities/RoomSense.prefab)
    for MRUK configuration. In particular, the `[BuildingBlock] Find Spawn Positions`
    GameObject is used to find the starting position for Golly Gosh and the language
    tree.  \n![SpawnPrefab.png](Images/MRUK/SpawnPrefab.png)\n\n## Sample Scenes\n\n![MRUK-Gym.png](Images/MRUK/MRUK-Gym.png) 
    \nIn [GymScene.unity](../Assets/SpatialLingo/Scenes/GymScene.unity), the MRUK
    panel allows toggling the overlay for your current room scan.\n\n![SpawnSample.png](Images/MRUK/SpawnSample.png) 
    \nIn [FindSpawnPositionsSample.unity](../Assets/SpatialLingo/Scenes/Samples/FindSpawnPositionsSample.unity),
    the floor placement building block from MRUK is used to place multilpe objects
    on the user's floor on start.\n"
