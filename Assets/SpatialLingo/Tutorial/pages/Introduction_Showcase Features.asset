    Each of these features have
    been built to be accessible and scalable for other developers to take and build
    upon in their own projects.



    ## Object Identification


    *Spatial Lingo*
    is able to identify objects around the user''s environment, allowing for spatial
    placement and dynamic generation of language lessons.



    ## Lesson Generation


    Dynamic
    vocabulary lessons are generated as the user progresses in growing the langauge
    tree. After objects are identified in the user''s environment, relevant verbs
    and adjectives for those objects are generated to allow for more lesson variety.



    ##
    Voice Synthesis


    Golly Gosh is able to speak in several different languages.
    Voice is dynamically synthesized from text, so they can teach users proper pronounciation
    during language lessons.



    ## Voice Transcription


    Users'' speech is
    transcribed when presented with a word cloud, which is also supported in several
    languages.



    ## Lesson Evaluation


    A user''s response is sent to Llama
    to determine if the user has responded well enough to complete a given lesson''s
    word cloud.
