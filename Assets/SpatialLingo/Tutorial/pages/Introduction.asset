    Spatial
    Lingo is a spatialized language practice experience, guiding users to identify
    and describe objects around their environment in a target language. This was
    made possible using Meta libraries, such as <a href="https://www.llama.com/">Llama</a>, 
    <a href="https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/unity/unity-mr-utility-kit-overview/">Mixed
    Reality Utility Kit (MRUK)</a>, and the <a href="https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/unity/voice-sdk-overview">Voice
    SDK</a>. This experience supports both hand tracking and controllers.


    Follow
    Golly Gosh (the polyglot!) as they lead you through your own, real-world space,
    allowing you to practice your vocabulary using familiar objects. Grow the language
    tree by completing lessons from Golly Gosh, learning nouns, verbs, and adjectives
    along the way!



    # Project Overview


    The **Spatial Lingo** project
    helps Unity developers understand and develop for multiple Meta features: Passthrough
    Camera API (PCA), Voice SDK, Interaction SDK, Mixed Reality Utility Kit (MRUK),
    Llama API, and Unity Sentis. The main scene as well as multiple sample scenes
    demonstrate the implementation and usefulness of each feature.
