    ## Introduction


    Voice
    transcription is achieved through a package provided by Meta and [wit.ai](https://wit.ai/).
    It''s used to listen for the user''s speech, and compare it to lesson objectives.


    ##
    Setup


    See [VoiceSynthesis.md](VoiceSynthesis.md) setup for installation
    steps.


    ## Scripts


    [VoiceTranscriber.cs](../Runtime/Scripts/VoiceTranscriber.cs)


    -
    This wraps wit.ai''s voice transcription. It triggers `VoiceTranscriptionUpdateIncomplete`
    word by word as the user speaks, and `VoiceTranscriptionUpdateComplete` when
    a pause has been detected in the user''s speech. This is primarily used in [ExerciseManager.cs](../../../Assets/SpatialLingo/Scripts/Lessons/ExerciseManager.cs)
    to compare spoken words with the given lesson.


    [STTLanguageSwitch.cs](../Runtime/Scripts/STTLanguageSwitch.cs)


    -
    This swaps the active wit.ai configuration, given a target language. This allows
    Spatial Lingo to listen for any language supported by wit.ai, as long as a configuration
    is provided. As soon as the user selects a language, this script activates the
    corresponding wit.ai configuration.
