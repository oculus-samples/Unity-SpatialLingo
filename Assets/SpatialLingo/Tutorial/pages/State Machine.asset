  m_overrideMarkdownText: "# State Machine & Unity Visual Scripting\n\n## Introduction\n\nSpatial
    Lingo's sequencing of events is primarily handled by Unity's [Visual Scripting](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.visualscripting@1.9/manual/index.html)
    package. This provides a node-based editor for developing high-level logic in
    a visual way. For Spatial Lingo, it's mostly used as a state machine, specifying
    the execution flow of logical units and managing contextual data.\n\n![AppFlow.png](Images/StateMachine/AppFlow.png)\n\n##
    Assets and Scripts\n\n### Appflow Asset\n\n[Assets/SpatialLingo/Data/StateGraph/AppFlow.asset](../Assets/SpatialLingo/Data/StateGraph/AppFlow.asset)\n\nThis
    manages the entire flow of the app, where developers can view and edit the states
    of the app as needed. Open this asset by double-clicking it, or by selecting
    it and clicking \"Edit Graph\" in the inspector window.\n\n### Scripts\n\n[Assets/SpatialLingo/Scripts/VisualScriptingUnits/*](../Assets/SpatialLingo/Scripts/VisualScriptingUnits)\n[Assets/SpatialLingo/Scripts/States/*](../Assets/SpatialLingo/Scripts/States)\n\nThese
    folders contain individual states that are indexed by the visual scripting package.
    They contain some abstraction layers to handle some common functionality when
    implementing a new node.\n\n[EventUnitWrapper.cs](../Assets/SpatialLingo/Scripts/VisualScriptingUnits/EventUnitWrapper.cs)
    and [ScriptingEvents.cs](../Assets/SpatialLingo/Scripts/VisualScriptingUnits/ScriptingEvents.cs)
    files in VisualScriptingUnits/ declare custom scripting events that can be used
    in the node editor. While the decision was made to transition away from visual
    scripting-related events, it serves as an example for abstracting event definitions
    to very small declarations.\n\n## Additional Tips\n\n- Adding the `IncludeInSettings`
    attribute to a plain C# class can allow its public members, static and instanced,
    to have nodes autogenerated for them by visual scripting. This includes constructors.
    For example, the following code block will add additional entries to the fuzzy
    finder after regenerating nodes:\n\n```csharp\nusing Unity.VisualScripting;\n\n[IncludeInSettings(true)]\npublic
    class NewEmptyCSharpScript\n{\n    public static string MyString { get; set;
    }\n    public string X;\n    public static int GetInt() => 5;\n}\n```\n\n![FuzzyFinder.png](Images/StateMachine/FuzzyFinder.png)\n"
