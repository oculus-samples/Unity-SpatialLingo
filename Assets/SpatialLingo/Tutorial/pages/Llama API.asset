    Llama is a Large Language Model
    AI, developed by Meta.





    While Llama can be used to accomplish many goals,
    the ones outlined here are targeted toward common use cases:


    - Ask questions,
    e.g.: ''What is a synonym for chair?''

    - Make queries about images, e.g.:
    ''What is in this image: {image}''

    - Translate data, e.g.: ''Translate "Hello"
    into Vietnamese.''

    - Format data or answers into JSON


    Getting the
    desired output from an AI relies mostly on constructing "prompts" (questions
    with context) worded in particular ways to generate suitable responses.


    There
    is a Meta provided Llama API service available to interface with various models.
    Multiple models are available, e.g.: Llama-3.3, and Llama-4, with different variations
    & targeted purposes.

    API Docs`</a>



    ### Getting Started


    Create an Account at: <a href="https://llama.developer.meta.com/">`Llama
    API`</a>.


    Create an API Key to pass in requests: <a href="https://llama.developer.meta.com/api-keys/">`API
    Keys`</a>.



    ## Common Use Cases



    ### Accurate Object Description


    The
    classification from object detection is a coarse (and sometimes incorrect) umbrella
    term for detected objects. Passing a cropped image of the subject item to Llama,
    the scene description is able to provide a more accurate and descriptive summary
    of the item.



    ### Generating Lesson Data (Word Clouds)


    Passing a
    descriptive noun along with an image of the corresponding object to the Llama
    scene description service, it is able to return a rich set of nouns, adjectives,
    and verbs.



    ### Translation


    Llama is used to translate the scene
    description results into both the user''s native language and the target language,
    to facilitate translation and language learning.



    ### Speech Evaluation


    Using
    a transcription of the user''s voice, Llama is used to evaluate a user''s response
    using multiple criteria, including checking for the presence of specific words
    and parts of speech (nouns, verbs, and adjectives).
